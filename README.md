# Babelboard project

The Babelboard project aims to make it simpler to prototype embedded Python systems by providing

1. Hardware that makes it easy to interconnect I2C and SPI peripherals to popular single board computers (SBCs).
1. Python/micropython/CircuitPython libraries that will drive the peripherals from the SBCs.

## Target SBCs

1. Raspberry Pi (all models)
2. Jetson Nano
3. Adafruit feathers and other Adafruit CircuitPython SBCs, including the PyPortal and Clue
4. The BBC micro:bit

## Target peripherals

1. Grove I2C peripherals
1. Adafruit featherwings (I2C and SPI)
1. Quick2Wire and Q2W2 boards
1. Pimoroni breakout garden peripherals (I2C and SPI)
1. Sparkfun Qwiik boards

As the project develops I will add documentation under the docs directory.

There's currently some documentation for two micro:bit libraries in `docs/microbit/REDAME.md`

The software is licensed under an MIT license.
